# assessment-component-metadata-records
The Assessment Interoperability Framework defines the DCAT Application Profile for both conceptual (e.g. Benchmark) and code (e.g. Test) entities.  These records may be stored anywhere on the Web, however this repository provides a generic location for archiving these records, such that they can then be indexed by FAIRsharing/OSTrails Index
